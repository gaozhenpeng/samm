<h1 id="proposed-overview">Proposed Overview</h1>

<p>The Policy &amp; Compliance (PC) Practice is focused on understanding and meeting external legal and regulatory requirements while also driving internal security standards to ensure compliance in a way that’s aligned with the business purpose of the organization.</p>

<p>A driving theme for improvement within this Practice is focused on describing organization&rsquo;s standards and 3rd party obligations as application requirements, enabling efficient and automated audits that may be leveraged within the SDLC and continuously demonstrate that all expectations are being met.</p>

<p>In a sophisticated form, provision of this Practice entails an organization-wide understanding of both internal standards and external compliance drivers while also maintaining low-latency checkpoints with project teams to ensure no project is operating outside expectations without visibility.</p>

<h1 id="a-policy-and-standards">A: Policy and Standards</h1>

<h2 id="maturity-1">Maturity 1</h2>

<h3 id="activity">Activity</h3>

<p>Develop a library of policies and standards to govern all aspects of software development in the organization.  Policies and standards should be developed based on existing industry standards and be appropriate for the organization&rsquo;s industry.  Due to the full range of technology-specific limitations and best practices, the organization should review proposed standards with the various product teams.  With the overarching objective of increasing security of the applications and computing infrattructure, individual product teams should be invited to offer feedback on any aspects of the standards that would not be feasible or cost-effective to implement, as well as opportunities for standards to go further with little effort on the product teams.</p>

<p>In creating policies, the emphasis should be on high-level definitions and aspects of application security that would not be dependent on a specific technology or a hosting environment.  Policies should emphasize broader objectives of the organization to protect the integrity of its computing environment, safety and privacy of the data, and maturity of the software development lifecycles.  For larger organizations, policies may qualify specific requirements based on data classification or application functionality, but should not be detailed enough to offer technology-specific guidance.</p>

<p>Standards should incorporate requirements set forth by policies, and focus on technology-specific implementation guidance intended to capture and take advantage of the security features of different programming languages and frameworks.  Creating standards requires input from senior developers and architects considered experts in various technologies in use by the organization, and created in a format allowing for frequent periodic updates.  Individual requirements should be labeled or tagged with the policy or a 3rd party requirement, which would make ongoing maintenance and audits easier and more efficient.</p>

<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat?</p>

<p><strong>Answer Options</strong>
- Option 1
- Option 2
- Option 3
- Option 4</p>

<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>

<p><em>&ldquo;Unify patchwork compliance obligations into a single pane-of-glass organizational view.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>include internal/external drivers/obligations into policies and standards</em></p>

<p><em>L1: provide organization wide guidance how to implement internal/external drivers/obligations for software
examples:
standards every team has to follow (e.g. where to compile from)
Action: update P&amp;C streams into separate policies / compliance streams (now there is overlap)</em></p>

<h2 id="maturity-2">Maturity 2</h2>

<h3 id="activity-1">Activity</h3>

<p>To assist with the ongoing implementation and verification of compliance with policies and standards, develop application security and appropriate tests scripts related to each applicable requirement.   These documents should be organized into libraries and be available to all application teams in formats most conducive for inclusion into each application.  These documents should be clearly labeled and linked to the policies and standards they represent, to assist with the ongoing updates and maintenance.  Additionally, policies and standards should be versioned and include detailed change logs with each iterative update to make ongoing inclusion into different product&rsquo;s SDLC easier.</p>

<p>Application security requirements should be written in a format most consistent with the existing requirements management processes and may include creating more than one version catering to different development methodologies or technologies.  The goal should be to make it easy for various product teams to incorporate policies and standards into their existing development lifecycles and require minimal interpretation of requirements.</p>

<p>Test scripts should help reinforce application security requirements through clear expectations of application functionality, as well as a guide any automated or manual testing efforts that may already be a part of the development process.   These efforts will not only help each team establish the current state of compliance with existing policies and standards but also help ensure compliance as applications continue to change in the future.</p>

<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat?</p>

<h4 id="notes-1">Notes</h4>

<h2 id="maturity-3">Maturity 3</h2>

<h3 id="activity-2">Activity</h3>

<p>Develop a program for measuring each application&rsquo;s compliance with existing policies and standards.  Reporting should include factors making different requirements mandatory and be reported consistently across all teams.  Whenever possible, compliance status should be tied into automated testing and reported with each version.  Compliance reporting should include the version of policies and standards as well as appropriate code coverage factors.</p>

<p>Non-compliant teams should be encouraged to review available resources such as security requirements and test scripts, to ensure non-compliance is not a result of inadequate guidance.  Issues resulting from insufficient guidance should be forwarded to the teams responsible for publishing application requirements and test scripts, to ensure inclusion in the future releases.  Issues resulting from the inability to meet policies and standards should be escalated to the appropriate teams empowered to accept application security risks.</p>
