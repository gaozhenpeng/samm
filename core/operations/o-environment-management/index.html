<h1 id="a-patching-and-updating">A: Patching (and Updating)</h1>

<h2 id="maturity-1">Maturity 1</h2>

<h3 id="activity">Activity</h3>

<p>Responsibilities for patching across the full stack are defined and known . Respective roles patch the particular components in a defined way. (to be updated - see notes)</p>

<h4 id="maturity-questions">Maturity Questions</h4>

<h5 id="q-1">Q 1</h5>

<p>Do projects document operational environment security requirements?</p>

<p><strong>Answer Options</strong>
SAMMQA-C:
- No
- Yes, a small percentage are/do
- Yes, at least half of them are/do
- Yes, the majority of them are/do</p>

<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>

<p>activities would be different for container based deployments
implictly assumes you have an overview of what needs to be patched.
coverage can be measured with the Q&amp;As
use maintenance windows to oppurtunistically patch/upgrade software
you know what patches are missing
identify patching dependencies
L1 - identify what matters and what is missing and prioritized best-effort patching
L2 - strategy , process , calendar
L3 - SLA / reporting</p>

<h2 id="maturity-2">Maturity 2</h2>

<h3 id="activity-1">Activity</h3>

<p>Update process is defined and documented across the full stack. Patches are not only applied when they are available; external sources are also used in order to gather intelligence about zero day vulnerabilities so that appropriate risk mitigationÂ steps can be carried out.</p>

<h3 id="maturity-questions-1">Maturity Questions</h3>

<h4 id="q-1-1">Q 1</h4>

<p>Is a consistent process used to apply upgrades and patches to critical dependencies?</p>

<p><strong>Answer Options</strong>
SAMMQA-G:
- No
- Yes, localized to business areas
- Yes, across the organization
- Yes, across the organization and required</p>

<h4 id="notes-1">Notes</h4>

<p>baseline or target levels defined
patch/upgrade calendar followed
manage process information (e.g. gap)</p>

<h2 id="maturity-3">Maturity 3</h2>

<h3 id="activity-2">Activity</h3>

<p>Conformity with the patch process is reliably evaluated. Nonconformities are handled as security findings, triaged and handled according to rules and SLAs stemming from the defect management practice.</p>

<h3 id="maturity-questions-2">Maturity Questions</h3>

<h4 id="q-1-2">Q 1</h4>

<p>Are stakeholders aware of options for additional tools to protect software while running in operations?</p>

<p><strong>Answer Options</strong>
SAMMQA-F:
- No
- Yes, teams write/run their own
- Yes, there is a standard set
- Yes, the standard set is integrated</p>

<h4 id="notes-2">Notes</h4>

<h1 id="b-hardening">B: Hardening</h1>

<h2 id="maturity-1-1">Maturity 1</h2>

<h3 id="activity-3">Activity</h3>

<p>Responsibilities for hardening software components across the full stack are defined and known. Software components are hardened according to publicly available sources with best practises.</p>

<h3 id="maturity-questions-3">Maturity Questions</h3>

<h4 id="q-1-3">Q 1</h4>

<p>Do projects check for security updates to third-party software components?</p>

<p><strong>Answer Options</strong>
SAMMQA-C:
- No
- Yes, a small percentage are/do
- Yes, at least half of them are/do
- Yes, the majority of them are/do</p>

<h4 id="notes-3">Notes</h4>

<p>description more L2 aligned, versus best-effort
full stack - too &ldquo;devopsy&rdquo;?
definition = configuration hardening?
L1 = identify what matters to protect your environment and what is missing and prioritized best-effort hardening</p>

<h2 id="maturity-2-1">Maturity 2</h2>

<h3 id="activity-4">Activity</h3>

<p>Hardening process is defined and documented across the full stack. Hardening baselines are available and used consistently.</p>

<h3 id="maturity-questions-4">Maturity Questions</h3>

<h4 id="q-1-4">Q 1</h4>

<p>Do projects leverage automation to check application and environment health?</p>

<p><strong>Answer Options</strong>
SAMMQA-C:
- No
- Yes, a small percentage are/do
- Yes, at least half of them are/do
- Yes, the majority of them are/do</p>

<h4 id="notes-4">Notes</h4>

<p>standards in place
standard way if deploying the baselines</p>

<h2 id="maturity-3-1">Maturity 3</h2>

<h3 id="activity-5">Activity</h3>

<p>Conformity with the hardening baselines is reliably evaluated. Nonconformities are handled as security findings, triaged and handled according to rules and SLAs stemming from the defect management practice.</p>

<h3 id="maturity-questions-5">Maturity Questions</h3>

<h4 id="q-1-5">Q 1</h4>

<p>Does a minimum security baseline exist for environment health (versioning, patching, etc)?</p>

<p><strong>Answer Options</strong>
SAMMQA-G:
- No
- Yes, localized to business areas
- Yes, across the organization
- Yes, across the organization and required</p>

<h4 id="notes-5">Notes</h4>

<p>non-conformities / self-healing (overwriting)</p>

      <p>OWASP is an international organization and the OWASP Foundation supports OWASP efforts around the world. OWASP is an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to conceive, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain applications that can be trusted. All of the OWASP tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem because the most effective approaches to application security include improvements in all of these areas.
